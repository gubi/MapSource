# A user agent may automatically redirect a request.
# A user agent should detect and intervene to prevent cyclical redirects

# 5xx Server Error
#
# The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.
# Response status codes beginning with the digit "5" indicate cases in which the server is aware that it has encountered an error or is otherwise incapable of performing the request.
# Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server should include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation, and indicate whether it is a temporary or permanent condition.
# Likewise, user agents should display any included entity to the user.
# These response codes are applicable to any request method.
